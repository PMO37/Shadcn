description: Install and configure Remix.

<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Remix project using `create-remix`:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest my-app
```

### Install Tailwind CSS

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Then we create the `tailwind.config.ts` and `postcss.config.js` files with:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init --ts -p
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

<Callout className="mt-6">
  **Note**: Be very careful with answering these questions, as the default values
  are similar to the ones we use in this guide.
  These are the questions that you will need to be careful with:

  - **Where is your global CSS file?** - Make sure to enter `app/tailwind.css`.
  - **Where is your tailwind.config.js located?** - Make sure to enter the `.ts` extension.
  - **Configure the import alias for components:** - Make sure to enter `~/components`.
  - **Configure the import alias for utils:** - Make sure to enter `~/lib/utils`.

</Callout>

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? yes
Which style would you like to use? > Default

Where is your global CSS file? > app/tailwind.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? > yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? > tailwind.config.ts
Are you using a custom tailwind prefix eg. tw-? (Leave blank if not) â€¦
Configure the import alias for components: > ~/components
Configure the import alias for utils: > ~/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? > no
Write configuration to components.json. Proceed? > yes
```

### Add `tailwind.css` to your app

In your `app/root.tsx` file, import the `tailwind.css` file:

```js {1, 4}
import styles from "./tailwind.css"

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: styles },
  ...(cssBundleHref ? [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: cssBundleHref }] : []),
]
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
