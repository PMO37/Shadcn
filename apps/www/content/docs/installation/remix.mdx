<Steps>

### Create project

Start by creating a new Remix project using `create-remix`:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest my-app
```

### Install Tailwind CSS

Install tailwindcss

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
If you would like to use TypeScript (recommended), you can init Tailwind CSS like this:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init --ts -p
```

Otherwise, you can init Tailwind CSS without TypeScript like this:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Then add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.ts file.

```js
import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'

export default {
  content: ['./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
} satisfies Config
```

Finally create a ./app/tailwind.css file and add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwind’s layers.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```



### Add `tailwind.css` to your app

In your `app/root.tsx` file, import the `tailwind.css` file:

```js {1, 4}
import type { LinksFunction } from "@remix-run/node";
import stylesheet from "~/tailwind.css?url";

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: stylesheet },
];
```

### Run the CLI

Run the `shadcn-ui` init command to setup your project:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? no / yes
Which style would you like to use? › Default
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Slate
Where is your global CSS file? › app/tailwind.css
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
Where is your tailwind.config.js located? › tailwind.config.js
Configure the import alias for components: › ~/components
Configure the import alias for utils: › ~/lib/utils
Are you using React Server Components? › no
```

### App structure

<Callout>

**Note**: This app structure is only a suggestion. You can place the files wherever you want.

</Callout>

- Place the UI components in the `app/components/ui` folder.
- Your own components can be placed in the `app/components` folder.
- The `app/lib` folder contains all the utility functions. We have a `utils.ts` where we define the `cn` helper.
- The `app/tailwind.css` file contains the global CSS.

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "~/components/ui/button"

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

</Steps>
